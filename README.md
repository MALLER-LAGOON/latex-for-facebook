# Latex for Facebook
Equations, formulas in Facebook. Very easy to use.

### How to use
Simply write `$` to before and after your LaTeX code.

Inline equation written between single `$`.

Examples:
- In mathematical terms, the sequence `$ F_n $` of Fibonacci numbers...
- Quadratic formula: `$ ax^2+bx+c=0 $`


Block equations written between double `$`.

Examples:
- Solution of quadratic equation:
  `$$ x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac\ }}{2a} $$`

### NOTE:
- Works: `$ ax^2+bx+c=0 $`
- Don't works: `$ax^2+bx+c=0$` <-- (See space surrounding `$` sign)

### CHANGES
